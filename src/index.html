<h1>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h1>

<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a text-based approach to describing how content contained within an HTML file is structured. This markup tells a web browser how to display text, images and other forms of multimedia on a webpage.</p>

<p>HTML is a formal recommendation by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is generally adhered to by all major web browsers, including both desktop and mobile web browsers. HTML5 is the latest version of the specification.</p>

<h2>Basic elements of HTML</h2>

<ul>

<li>Block-level elements start on a new line in the document and take up their own space. Examples of these elements include headings and paragraph tags.</li>

<li>Inline elements do not start on a new line in the document and only take up necessary space. These elements usually format the contents of block-level elements. Examples of inline elements include hyperlinks and text format tags.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Pros and cons of HTML</h2>

<ol>

<li>Is widely adopted with a large amount of resources available.</li>

<li>Is relatively easy to learn.</li>

<li>Does not have very dynamic functionality and is mainly used for static web pages.</li>

</ol>

<h2>How to use and implement HTML</h2>

<p>Because HTML is completely text-based, an HTML file can be edited simply by opening it up in a program such as Notepad++, Vi or Emacs. Any text editor can be used to create or edit an HTML file and, so long as it is named with an .html file extension, any web browser -- such as Chrome or Firefox -- will be capable of displaying the file as a webpage.</p>

<h2>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h2>

<p>HTML is used to create webpages but does experience limitations when it comes to fully responsive components. Therefore, HTML should only be used to add text elements and structure them within a page. For more complex features, HTML can be combined with cascading style sheets (CSS) and JavaScript (JS).</p>

<p><strong>HTML 1.0</strong> --<em> released in 1992</em> -- <span>had very limited capability and around 20 elements.<span></p>

<p><strong>HTML 2.0</strong> --<em> released in 1995</em> -- <span> began to incorporate elements relating to math functions.<span></p>

<p><strong>HTML 5.3</strong> --<em> yet to be released </em> -- <span>W3C is collaborating with WHATWG on a new version. The collaboration began in 2019.<span></p>
